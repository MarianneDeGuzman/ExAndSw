			<td>Jack Hughes-Hughes achieved the eighth-youngest hat trick in Devils, Colorado Rockies, and Kansas City Scouts history. Additionally, it was the first natural hat trick since Brian Boyle on November 5, 2018, and the 13th in franchise history. He has a net worth of $3 million.</td>

			<td>Elias Pettersson-On his team, Elias Pettersson is already regarded as the most crucial player. The No. 1 centre (and his health) are crucial to the Vancouver Canucks' success, despite the fact that their top-six contains a number of talented players. He has a net worth od $14,575,000.</td>

			<td>Mitch Marner-In 2021, he was seventh in the league in terms of points scored per game, just 0.05 points per 60 behind Matthews.If the season hadn't been cut short, he would have been on track for nearly 100 points, and he's a crucial component of what might be the league's most dangerous line. This season, Marner and the Toronto Maple Leafs have a lot to prove. He is worth worth $65.3 million.</td>

			<td>David Pastrnak-This forward is a genuine franchise cornerstone; he is the kind of prospect that teams hope to select in the top five of the draft. It's incredible that the Bruins selected him with the 25th pick. He has a networth of $80 million.</td>
